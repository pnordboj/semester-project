# Semester Project 2

This project is a web application that allows users to bid on auctions and view the current highest bids.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following packages:

- `bootstrap`: This package provides the Bootstrap CSS framework, which is used to style the user interface of the web application.
- `live-server`: This package is used to run a local development server that automatically refreshes the page when changes are made to the source code.
- `sass`: This package is used to compile SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) code into regular CSS.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in this project:

- `watch`: This script runs the `sass` compiler in watch mode, which means it will automatically recompile SASS files into CSS whenever they are changed. It also runs the `live-server` development server, which will automatically refresh the page when changes are made to the code.
- `build`: This script runs the `sass` compiler to compile all SASS files into CSS.

To run a script, use the `npm run` command followed by the name of the script. For example, to run the `watch` script, you would use the command: `npm run watch`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running the `npm install` command.
